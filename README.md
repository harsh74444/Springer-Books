# Springer-Books
Springer issued a list of pdf books available for free on its website after the outbreak of Covid-19. The python code will help one in finding relevant books in the pdf (similar to search functionality in pdf reader) and downloading it on their local machine without visiting the website. 
It is a very basic code written in python and asks for certain inputs like where the pdf file is located, search keyword, location for saving the pdf, and name for the downloading pdf.
